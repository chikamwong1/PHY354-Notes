**What is this?**

These are lecture notes for Michael Luke's 2024 S section. These lecture notes are not official by any means, and typos do exist. Several lectures also have notes that do not do them justice (in particular, lecture 4 and lecture 24). If you want to understand physics, please do go to class and do not blindly reference these notes as they do not describe the whole picture.
